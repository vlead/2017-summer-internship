* Project Details
  Few lines about the project and the duration on the project.
  - Our project was about building Vlabs Platform and using
    experiment as a service.

  - The project required us to create microservices which work
    together and build a platform where users can develop experiments
    in a markup language (org supported for now) without any
    dependence on how they are served.

  - The platform automatically generates the resources as =HTML= files
    and hosts them on the server.

  - When we started working on it, only the =translators= module was
    up and running.

  - We made necessary changes in it and created =resource-generator=
    and =content-server= modules.

  - =translators= service was using =pygithub= to interact with
    Github. We made our own module which interacts with Github using
    Github API v3.

  - We have deployed the microservices and made a release.

  - The platform is up and running now.
  
* Project Outcome
  The microservices are deployed and they are tested. We have also
  made a sample experiment using this platform.
