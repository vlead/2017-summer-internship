* Introduction
  This is the final report of Utkarsh.
* About Project(s)
  The project's aim was to design a user-friendly dashboard 
  for LDS (Lab Data Service). Main motivation remained to 
  minimise the user's efforts in accessing and manipulating 
  data from all the virtual labs. It was developed as an SPA
  (Single Page Application) using plain JavaScript without 
  any frameworks.

* Project Outcome
  - We have developed data service dashboard using
    plain JavaScript without the help of any
    frameworks.
  - Absence of frameworks allows manipulation of
    code to incorporate any features within the limit  
    of the language.
  - JSON has a great potential when it comes to
    automating procedures like generation of html
    code.
  - Hash routing allows us to embed the exact state
    of the web app in the page URL.
  - Attaching element to an id instead of doing the
    opposite can allow unit-testing of DOM elements.
