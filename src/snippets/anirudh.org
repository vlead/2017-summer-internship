* Project
  - Modelling a web app in Alloy:: The first project i worked on was using a specification 
       language(like alloy) to model our web app.This was done in order to see that all the 
       requirements of the app are met and also are correct without actually writing the real code.
  - Modular devolopment of routes in the web app :: The second project I did was to complete the routes 
       for various operations(like addrole,setemail etc totally 12 of them) modularly.Here modular development 
       is important inorder to use each module independently.
 
  - Internship Experience :: My experience at this internship was amazing as I 
       got to learn many things such as a new language Alloy, modular development 
       and also a lot of techniques  which are used all over the world.Overall it was
       great working under Professor Venkatesh Choppella and Thirumal Sir.
