* Introduction
  This document hols the time sheets for my work during the summer internship
  at VLEAD, IIIT Hyderabad

* Month of June
** Week 1 [2017-06-01 Thu] till [2017-06-04 Sun]
   + [2017-06-01 Thu] -
     - The mentors were introduced and the projects were assigned in the
       morning.
     - Project currently being worked on is the rewriting of the
       =web-app-short-course= in Haskell.
     - I read the requirements, documentation and code for the =web-app-short-course=
     - I noted ideas on how to implement it in Haskell, and the (intended)
       differences between the original implementation and the Haskell
       implementation. These will be later uploaded in a notes file.
     - I also made a note of problems we will face in the implementation, and
       discussed with my mentor about resources needed
     - Additionally, I compared two Haskell web frameworks- Servant and
       Yesod- to see which one is more appropriate for my implementation.
   + [2017-06-02 Fri] - 
     - The API for the webapp will be realised using the Servant web framework,
       as this web framework ensures the type safety of routes and return
       values.
     - I explored the Servant API tool (using the tutorial provided with the Servant
       documentation) and read three sample projects written in servant
       (including one that uses the Persistent database tool to interact with
       the database layer)
     - I also learned the use of the stack build tool for haskell
     - To test the feasibility of building the API using Servant and to
       familiarise myself with Stack, I built and debugged an example web app with a single
       route that returned a list of users when called
** Week 2 [2017-06-05 Mon] till [2017-06-11 Sun]
   + [2017-06-05 Monday]
     - Had a meeting with Prof. Choppella, my project mentor, in the morning
     - Wrote a skeleton webapp with two routes, =showUsers= and =addUsers=
     - Functions to handle these two routes have not been implemented yet-
       currently using placeholder functions
     - Also wrote a skeleton user data model using template haskell and
       haskell-Persistent
     - Wrote code to connect the skeleton API and the skeleton database model
     - The purpose of doing this is to get a feasible working model of a server
       using the Servant API library and the Persistent database library. Once
       I have such a working model, I can add other aspects of the
       implementation to it. 
     - A significant portion of the afternoon was spent in debugging the code
       (mostly library import issues- added all necessary libraries to
       =webapp-tryout.cabal=)
     - There's a bug in the type naming. Will look at it later
     - All work done today has been committed to the =web=app-haskell=
       repository
   + [2017-06-06 Tuesday]
     - Previous day's error resolved.
     - Went through Haskell theory, particularly relating to the concepts of
       type-level strings, type-level lists and type families.
     - Had an issue with Stack- namely, that it had =src= as the default source
       code directory instead of =build/code=. Issue resolved.
     - Fixed a few more issues. Set =Role= as an ADT- therefore ensuring the
       type-safety of =Role= value. Found out how to write custom FromJSON and
       ToJSON instances of ADTs.
     - Had a meeting with my project mentor- Prof. Choppella- Prof. Soma,
       Prof. Kesav Nori and another professor about projects related to
       linguistics and Haskell, from 11:30am to 1:30pm.
     - Worked on implementing handlers for the /showUsers and /addUsers routes.
   + [2017-06-07 Wednesday]
     - Made a very crude version of the webapp that works.
   + [2017-06-08 Thursday]
     - Worked on implementing login/logout routes.
   + [2017-06-09 Friday]
     - Finished implementation of login/logout routes and index page route. 
     - Gave a presentation about progress in this project so far.

* Month of July
