* Introduction
  This document holds the time sheets for my work during the summer internship
  at VLEAD, IIIT Hyderabad

* Month of June
** Week 1 [2017-06-01 Thu] till [2017-06-04 Sun]
*** [2017-06-01 Thu]
+ Set up the working environment that included installing vagrant and setting up a ubuntu 14.04 Virtual Machine.
+ Went through the documentation of these repos [[https://github.com/vlead/vlabs-platform/]] and [[https://github.com/vlead/translators/]].
+ Discussed the project with mentor and teammate.
+ Tried setting up the translator which creates a github repo out of the =json=
  specification using a /Code Skeletal Generator/, but got errors.

** Week 2 [2017-06-05 Mon] till [2017-06-11 Sun]
*** [2017-06-05 Mon]
+ Had a meeting with the mentor regarding goals (milestones) to be achieved in this week.
+ Set up the /Code Skeletal Generator/ or the /Translator/
  ([[https://github.com/vlead/translators/]]).
+ Had to fix some bugs to make the translator work (one of them being the
  space-hiphen inconsistency while creating github repos).
+ Successfully created the repo
  [[https://github.com/test-platform-to-to-deleted/Final-e99233]] from the =json=
  specification using the =create_experiment_lab= API.

*** [2017-06-06 Tue]
   + Set the OpenEdX Platform release Eucalyptus up in my machine.
   + Hosted the OpenEdX studio and checked whether the =tar.gz= file created by
     the =Translator API= yesterday is compatible with it. It created a course
     successfully in the studio.
   + Fixed this [[https://github.com/vlead/translators/issues/3][issue]] in the translator API.
   + My teammate and I sat with the mentor and set the milestones for this week, which is creating the
     LDS API.

*** [2017-06-13 Tue]
    + Started coding the Resource Generator microservice
    + Completed one of the APIs (/resource) which generates the resource (html
      files) from the Github repos of experiments containing md/org files.

      update the specs of an experiment.
    + Updated the generation of README.org

*** [2017-06-20 Tue]
    + Merged the =/update_experiment= with the =/create_experiment=. Now

    + The resource files are ready except =simulation= section.

*** [2017-06-21 Wed]

    + =pygithub= not working on server, so decided that we'll be
      building a new package which can handle Github APIs.
    + Deployed =resource-generator= using =apache2=.

*** [2017-07-07 Fri]
    + Deployed =content-server= using =apache2=.
